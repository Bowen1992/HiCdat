Data for pre-processing tutorial:

For the tutorial in R, download the package and the archives below, unpack the two archives, and open "HiCdat-tutorial-arabidopsis.R" in a text editor and follow the instructions. Note that HiCdatR requires the R libraries "gplots", "randomizeBE", "MASS", and "HiCseg". You can install them with install.packages("gplots"), install.packages("randomizeBE"), install.packages("MASS"), and install.packages("HiCdat"). The HiCdat package HiCdatR can be installed with install.packages("/path/to/HiCdatR_0.99.0.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type = "source").

If you encounter problems, please contact me.

NOTE: if you encounter problems installing one of the R packages (other than HiCdatR), try to install it via [Bioconductor](http://http://www.bioconductor.org/):

```R
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("insertNameOfPackageHere")
```

NOTE: On linux, GLIBC needs to be at least version 2.14. Biolinux6 has a lower version.

About HiCdat:

HiCdat is an implementation of all data analysis approaches employed in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276514006029">Grob et al. 2014</a>.
Importantly, HiCdat is focussed on analysis of larger structural features of chromosomes and on comparative studies.

(<strong>A-B</strong>) After sequencing and initial quality checks have been performed, the read-ends (f: forward, r: reverse) are aligned separately to a reference genome. (<strong>C-D</strong>) After pairing the separately aligned read-ends, each end is mapped to genomic fragments, which are either genomic bins with a fixed size or restriction fragments with variable size. (<strong>E</strong>) Genomic fragments can be associated with various data types to test for correlation and enrichment of Hi-C data with genomic and epigenetic features. (<strong>F</strong>) Finally, the data can be conveniently analyzed in R using HiCdatR.
